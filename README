This tool is using sm2 to sign and verify, and the information of the 
original version can be found  above.

And in this version I just modify the "sbsign" and "sbverify" commond.


Before the install, you should make sure the gmssl is installed.
Beside,you may do the following:
export CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/ssl/include"
export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/ssl/lib"
export LIBS="-ldl"
to import the lib path of the gmssl and prepare for compiling!

You can find build-depends packages from the following website:(http://packages.ubuntu.com/zh-cn/source/precise/sbsigntool)

If you have finished the installation, you can do the following to generate
a key and cert and then exerience the signtool.

	1.generate a private key:
		gmssl ecparam -genkey  -name secp112r1 -out eckey.pem
	2.use the key to generate a cert
		gmssl req -new -x509 -key eckey.pem -out eckey.cert
	3.use the private key (and cert) to sign a efi file
		sbsign --key eckey.pem --cert eckey.cert --output test.efi grubx64.efi
	4.use the cert to verify the signed file
		sbverify --cert eckey.cert test.efi
